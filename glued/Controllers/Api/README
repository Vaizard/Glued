JSON SCHEMA

* Implementations: http://json-schema.org/implementations
* Generate schemas from example data: http://www.jsonschema.net/
* Validator in use: https://github.com/geraintluff/jsv4-php
* Online validator: http://jsonschemalint.com/#/version/draft-04/markup/json

DONE

* Selected jsv4-php as the backend validator
* Enveloped all api paths into a group that has access the jsv4 class.
* Written the first test schema (see Controllers/Api/v0_1/schemas/timepixels.json)
* Tested validity of GET glued/public/api/0.1/timepixels/1 against the timepixels.json schema with the Online validator.

TODO

* TODO consider moving jsv4 class loading into an (as of yet nonexistent) API base controller
* Break up timepixels.json schema into components, test embedding/referencing with jsv4-php. Also see

* Choose/test form generation frontend library to generate sample forms (also capable of schema referencing) and aid with setting the correct combination of "required" rules
  * Vue implementation https://github.com/icebob/vue-form-generator
  * Another implementation, online demo http://jeremydorn.com/json-editor/
